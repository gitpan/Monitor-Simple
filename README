Monitor-Simple

The Monitor::Simple allows simple monitoring of applications and
services of your IT infrastructure. There are many such tools, some of
them very complex and sophisticated. For example, one widely used is
Nagios (http://www.nagios.org/). The Monitor::Simple does not aim, as
its name indicates, for all features provided by those tools. It
allows, however, to check whether your applications and services are
running correctly. Its simple command-line interface can be used in
cron jobs and reports can be viewed as a single HTML or text page.
